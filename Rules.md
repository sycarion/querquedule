# Querquedule!
You are a cyberteal on a mission to clear a plague of locusts and prevent the rise of the Querquedule Technocracy.

## Parts Needed

- 12 Round Discs (dimes work well)
- 1 Player Token

- At least 3 regular dice

- Printed copy of the map

- Pencil


## Object

The object of the game is to clear the map of locusts with 12 moves or less. You have various anatine and cybertech abilities at your disposal to help you in your mission.

## Setup

**Creating your Teal:** You have two abilities, Querquedule and Cybertech. Roll one die for each stat to determine your score for each one.

**Placing the Locusts:** Roll six regular dice and place one die next to each row of the map. No die can be next to another die of the same value. If four or more dice have the same value, re-roll them all. Place a disc token in the column that matches the number on the die for each row.

Re-roll the six dice and place one next to each row of the map. Again, two dice with the same value cannot be next to each other. If a die would cause a locust token to be stacked on another, re-roll that individual die. As long as the result is different from the previous roll, place the token in the column that matches the value of the rerolled die. This is true even if the roll results in a value that is same to another die above and/or below it.

**Placing your Teal:**

Roll two dice to place your teal at a starting point. One die represents the row number, the other represents to column number. You may order the dice as you like.

*Example:* Rolling a 3 and a 5, you may place your teal in the third row on the fifth column or the fifth row in the third column.
