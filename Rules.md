# Querquedule!
You are a cyberteal on a mission to clear a plague of locusts and prevent the rise of the Querquedule Technocracy.

## Parts Needed

- 12 Round Discs (dimes work well)
- 1 Player Token

- At least 3 regular dice

- Printed copy of the map

- Pencil


## Object

The object of the game is to clear the map of locusts with 12 moves or less. You have various anatine and cybertech abilities at your disposal to help you in your mission.

## Setup

**Creating your Teal:** You have two abilities, Querquedule and Cybertech. Roll one die for each stat to determine your score for each one.

*Example:* Rolling a 4 and a 5, the player decides to make 4 the Querquedule stat and 5 the  Cybertech stat.

**Placing the Locusts:** Roll six regular dice and place one die next to each row of the map. No die can be next to another die of the same value. If four or more dice have the same value, re-roll them all. Place a disc token in the column that matches the number on the die for each row.

Re-roll the six dice and place one next to each row of the map. Again, two dice with the same value cannot be next to each other. If a die would cause a locust token to be stacked on another, re-roll that individual die. As long as the result is different from the previous roll, place the token in the column that matches the value of the rerolled die. This is true even if the roll results in a value that is same to another die above and/or below it.

### Locust Placement Example

Rolling six dice provides these results:

I cannot place the 1's like this:

![bad_placement](/home/sycarion/SparkleShare/github.com/querquedule/img/bad_placement.png)

One or more dice must be placed between the 1's.

The player arranges their dice like this and places tokens accordingly:

The next roll of six dice produces this result:

![second_roll](/home/sycarion/SparkleShare/github.com/querquedule/img/second_roll.png)

A four cannot be placed in the fourth row because the token would be placed on top of a token already placed on the board. The same is true for one of the rolled fives on the fifth row.

Being careful to avoid placing the fours next to each or placing the fives next to each other, the player adds the token like this. (The second placement is shown in blue in this example.)

**Placing your Teal:**

Roll two dice to place your teal at a starting point. One die represents the row number, the other represents to column number. You may order the dice as you like.

*Example:* Rolling a 2 and a 4, you may place your teal in the second row on the fourth column or the fourth row in the second column. In this example, the player chooses Row 2, Column 4. (Shown in dark teal below)
