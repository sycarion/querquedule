# Querquedule!
Querquedule is a game about a teal sent to lead a squad of specially trained ducks to eliminate a plague of locusts. Implanted with cutting-edge technology and channeling the power of your alatine ancestors, you must eliminate the locusts without losing your soul.

(Granted, if you lose your soul, you do end of taking over the planet and setting up the Querquedule Technocracy. If you do not destroy the locusts, you are set free to live out the remainder of your life in the wild as a truly awesome duck.)

## Acknowledgements

The original idea came from a tweet by [@BlueBerryyRRH](https://twitter.com/BlueBerryyRRH/status/1232999970258722817). I didn't know that this was also a game that I've always wanted to play. Faced with this knowledge, I created it.

Also thanks to the [phrontistery](http://phrontistery.info/) for helping me find the name of a species of teal that is the name of this game.

That said, I only ask you let me know if you like the game and/or make changes to it. This comes from a place of wanting to see how folks enjoy it, not from any dreams of monetizing it or otherwise stealing ideas.
